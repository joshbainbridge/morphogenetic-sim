Morphogenetic Simulation:
=======

This repository was my project submission for the Animation and Software Engineering module I did while studing at Bournemouth University. It is the simulation and rendering of a morphogenetic simulation, roughly based upon the paper 'Cellular Forms' by Andy lomas. I also wrote a multi-threaded pathtracer (based upon Kajiya's original paper) to visuallize the cells with an interactive user interface using NGL and the Qt library.
