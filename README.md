Morphogenetic Simulation:
=======

This repository was my project submission for the Animation and Software Engineering module I did while studing at Bournemouth University. It is the simulation of a morphogenetic process, based upon the paper 'Cellular Forms' by Andy Lomas. I also wrote a multi-threaded pathtracer (based upon Kajiya's original paper) to visualize the cells with an interactive user interface using NGL and the Qt library. A user example can be found here https://vimeo.com/124678271.
